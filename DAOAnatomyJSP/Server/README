Ensure your DEPLOYMENT ASSEMBLY is configured as follows:

1. /Server/build/classes -> WEB-INF/classes

2. /Server/lib           -> WEB-INF/lib

3. /Server/WEB-INF       -> WEB-INF

4. /WebContent           -> /


NB. Eclipse does NOT save these on exit, so you'll need to set them up each time you restart Eclipse
