This directory contains an abortive attempt to convert an OBO format
file into an anatomy database.  The OBO file that I tried to do this
with was an early version of the Xenopus anatomy.

However, there was just too much unfinished business in the Xenopus
anatomy to make this effort worthwhile.  I wrote a separate program
that defined just the subset of anatomy that EuReGene cares about.


So, is this directory a complete waste of magenetic media?

Maybe.


Formats
-------

Our long term plan at the Mouse Atlas is to use OBO-Edit, and
therefore OBO format.  However, OBO has several formats to pick from.
All of the code here deals with OBO format 1.0, but OBO format 1.2 is
better and OBO-XML format may be even better.  

The Obo* modules here can probably be adapted to work with OBO format
1.2, but they won't be very helpful for OBO-XML.  If we go with OBO
format 1.2 then please give these files a look.  They are adept at
parsing in most (possibly all) of an OBO format 1.0 file.

-----

xenopusOboToAnatomy.py was written to create an anatomy database from
scratch.  The created database would have no history in it whatsoever.

This may be very different from the situation if we use OBO-Edit to
update our mouse database.  In this case, we might by reading
incremental changes from an OBO file.  This requires us to detect what
has changed between the OBO file and the database.
xenopusOboToAnatomy.py does not give you much guidance on how to do
that.


Good luck, and I wish that I could have done this work.  I think it
will be fun.
