This directory contains scripts to convert a version 3 anatomy database to a
version 4 anatomy database.

To perform the conversion apply the convert.sql script to your database:

  mysql --show-warnings -u_username_ -p_password_ _dbname_ < convert.sql

NOTE:
  The SQL in updateSiblingOrder.sql is slightly different from that which
  was actually used to produce version 4 of the database.  The SQL that was
  used contained some slight errors.  These errors are fixed in the version
  of updateSiblingOrder.sql you see here.  They are also fixed in the
  schemaPre.sql file for converting to version 5.

  So, if you use the version 4 dump (which corresponds to what is actually
  in the EuReGene and GUDMAP databases), you will see a slightly different
  ordering then if you load the version 3 dump and then convert it with these
  scripts.

  Unless you are studying how to convert from one version to another, load
  database version 4 from the dump.

  Version 5 will be derived from the version 4 dump file.

  No one uses Version 3, so no one will actually be doing the version 3 to 4
  conversion.
