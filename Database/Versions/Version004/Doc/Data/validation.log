***** Results of validating the anatomy database. *****
This runs a series of tests, displaying a test description, followed by any
data that fails the test.  If all data passes then no data is displayed.
This log file is provided to let you know where data in the database does
not conform to expectiations.

... 1/2 done

... done

TEST: ANAD_PART_OF has only one root node.

TEST: First record in ANAD_PART_OF is a root node.

TEST: Every parent-child pair in ANAD_PART_OF has a relationship in ANA_RELATIONSHIP.

TEST: Every parent-child part-of pair in ANA_RELATIONSHIP is in ANAD_PART_OF.

TEST: ANAD_PART_OF node stage window reflects timed nodes.

TEST: ANAD_PART_OF node stage window >= path stage window

TEST: ANAD_PART_OF child stage ranges within parent's.

TEST: ANAD_PART_OF sequence values are dense.

TEST: ANAD_PART_OF depth increases by at most 1 (slow)
