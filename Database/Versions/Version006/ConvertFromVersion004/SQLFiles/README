This directory contains scripts to convert a version 4 anatomy database to a
version 6 anatomy database.

To perform the conversion apply the convert.sql script to your database:

  mysql --show-warnings -u_username_ -p_password_ _dbname_ < convert.sql

NOTE:
  Sibling Ordering is now handled internally, without the assistance of 
  a Python Program

  Updates to the data held in the Anatomy database are now performed via
   OBO Edit and the DB2OBO convertor program
