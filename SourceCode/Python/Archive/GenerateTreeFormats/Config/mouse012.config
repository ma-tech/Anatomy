# Configuration file fo the Anatomy Tree report generator
#
# File format rules
# 1. Blank lines and lines that start with "#" or " " are ignored.
# 2. Lines that set parameters have
#    o Parameter name, starting in first column
#    o Followed by a space, an equals sign, and another space,
#    o followed by the value to assign to that space.
#
# To generate absolutely every report, use these settings:
#   OUTPUT_FORMATS = PLAIN_TEXT RICH_TEXT XML
#   ABSTRACT_REPORTS = GROUPS_TRAILING GROUPS_EMBEDDED
#   STAGE_REPORTS = GROUPS_TRAILING GROUPS_EMBEDDED
#   STAGE_FILES = SEPARATE CONCATENATED
#   DEPTH_LIMIT = NONE
#
# To generate just the report that is then manually edited and then
# fed to the UpdateSiblingOrder parser, use these settings:
#   OUTPUT_FORMATS = PLAIN_TEXT
#   ABSTRACT_REPORTS = GROUPS_TRAILING
#   STAGE_REPORTS = NONE
#   STAGE_FILES = NONE
#   DEPTH_LIMIT = NONE
#
# If you are updating the sibling order iteratively, then increase the
# DEPTH_LIMIT from 1 by 1 with each iteration.

# For runs that generate stage specific reports, should the reports
# be concatenated in one file, or in a separate file for each stage,
# or both?  Options are CONCATENATED, SEPARATE, or both.

# Limit depth of trees in report to this depth.  A depth of 0 says
